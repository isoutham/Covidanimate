# Covidanimate
Just some visualisations of the spread of covid in NL per Gemmeente
The figures used are confirmed cases per 100K population in a specific Gemeente

If you want to play with it you will need a check out of CoronaWatchNL (for the data).
https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL

This is a collation of many data sources that is marvellously compiled and maintained by the University of Utrecht.

Just check it out into a parallel directory and run animate.py
